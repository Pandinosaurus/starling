<h1 style="text-align:center">Starling user guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Starling is a tool for graphically building image and video processing, by connecting several elementary blocks.</p>

<table style="border-style:none">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="user_guide/main_window.png" width="500"/>
		</td>
		<td>
			<table style="border-style:none">
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img src="user_guide/show_1.png"/>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
				<img src="user_guide/show_2.png"/> 
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>At run time, the block graph is converted into C++ code, which is compiled and executed. The two windows on the right in above illustration, are produced by the C++ generated program.</p>

<p>Starling is to be considered as a fast prototyping tool that produces C++ examples of using OpenCV and LIRIS-VISION features.

<h2>Build a workflow</h2>

<p>Use the toolbox located on the left side of the screen to select a block. Drag'n Drop it on the white canvas to start a processing chain.</p>

<img src="user_guide/dragndrop_block.jpg" width="300"/>

<p>Blocks may have inputs and/or outputs. Clicking on one output (at the right side of the block) will initiate a connector; clicking on an input (left side of the block) will confirm it.</p>

<table style="border-style:none">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="user_guide/initiate_connection.jpg"/>
		</td>
		<td width="200">
		</td>
		<td>
			<img src="user_guide/confirm_connection.jpg"/>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Outputs and inputs are of a given type (e.g. image, point, rectangle, integer). Connections are only possible between ports of the same type.</p>

<p>`Information flow` is propagated through blocks starting from the `source` blocks (blocks without inputs). A block with all its required inputs connected to `flowing` connectors will have flow. Blocks with flow are indicated by black border.</p>

<p>Red border means that the block hasn't the `information flow`, because one required input is missing. Blocks without `information flow` won't be processed.</p>

<p>In the top of the block selection toolbox, there is a search field (Ctrl+F). Enter the name of an operation to quickly find it.</p>

<p>The LIRIS-VISION blocks are available in the left panel, under the `Liris-Vision` item.<p>

<h2>Change block parameters values</h2>

<p>To view one block's properties, click twice on the block. This will open a new window with some indications about the block parameters, its inputs and ouputs. The values of the parameters can be changed here. Click OK button to confirm.<p>

<h2>Run the workflow</h2>

<p>When the workflow is built, click the Run button (or press F9) to execute it. The workflow is then translated in C++ code, compiled, and executed. Compilation errors appears in the console.</p> 

<p>When viewing a live feed (video from files or streams), click the Stop button (or press ESC key) to exit, or SPACE key to pause (make sure the video output window is selected).</p>

<h2>Get the C++ code</h2>

<p>Click the "View C code" button (or press F11 key) to open an editor containing the C++ code corresponding to the last executed workflow.</p>

<table style="border-style:none">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="user_guide/workflow.jpg" width="300"/>

	</tr>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>Useful examples can be accessed within the Examples menu:</p>

<p>The configuration of Starling can be changed through the preferences window. It is accessible by the 'Edit > Preferences' menu option.</p>
<img src="user_guide/preferences_window.png" width="500"/>
<p>
The configuration parameters are:<br>
- the LIRIS-VISION base directory (to use LIRIS-VISION blocks),<br>
- informations on the OpenCV library to use,<br>
- informations on other libraries to use,<br>
- the places to search for local blocks.
</p>
<p>Paths can be absolute or relative. Relative paths are relative to Starling directory.</p>
<p>The preferences are saved in an xml file named '.starling.conf', in the user's home directory. Use the '-c' option at start up to use another configuration file.</p>
