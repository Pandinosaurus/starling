# starling
Starling is a graphical tool to build simple computer-vision applications.

Starling provides an easy to use graphical environment to experiment computer vision, and to generate C++ code examples of vision algorithms use. It relies on the OpenCV library (www.opencv.org).

It's a fork of the Harpia project (http://s2i.das.ufsc.br/harpia/en/home.html). Main improvements from Harpia 1.1 are:
 - generates C++ code using OpenCV 2.x C++ API,
 - makes new module integration easier by adding just one xml file,
 - replaces some components by new standards (XML parser, canvas).

It can also be used for OpenCV experimenting and learning.

Starling runs on Linux and Windows.
